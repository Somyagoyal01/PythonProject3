# Even or Odd Number Checker

## Functionality
This Python program determines whether a given integer is even or odd. It follows these steps:

1. Prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. Uses an `if-else` statement to check if the number is divisible by 2.
3. Displays whether the number is **even** or **odd**.

## Expected Behavior
- If the user enters an even number (e.g., `4`), the output will be:
  ```
  Number is even
  ```
- If the user enters an odd number (e.g., `7`), the output will be:
  ```
  Number is odd
  Thank you
  ```

## Usage
Simply run the Python script, input a number, and the program will determine whether it is even or odd.

# Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

## Functionality
This Python program calculates the sum of all integers from **1 to 50** using a `for` loop. It follows these steps:

1. Initializes a list containing numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Iterates through the list using a `for` loop.
3. Adds each number to a cumulative sum.
4. Displays the sum at each step.

## Expected Behavior
- The program prints the cumulative sum after each iteration.
- The final output will display the total sum of numbers from **1 to 50**.

## Usage
Run the Python script, and it will sequentially display the cumulative sum until it reaches the final total.
